# File Upload

#### 📂 **Course Folder**
- [ ] I have uploaded my files in a new folder named after my course (e.g., `data-8/`, `espm-163/`, `econ-148/`, etc.). This folder exists within another folder for my university/institution (e.g. `ucb/`, `sdsu/`, etc.)
- [ ] My pull request **does not modify any other folders** except the one I created.  

#### 📄 **File Types**  
- [ ] My folder contains only data files (`.csv`, `.json`, `.xlsx`, etc.) and/or Python files (`.py`) and/or Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.svg`, `etc.`.  

#### 📏 **File Size**  
- [ ] Each file is **under 50MB**.  
- [ ] If a file exceeded 50MB, I have **split it into multiple smaller files** and included clear instructions on how to **reconstruct** the data in the Jupyter notebook.  

#### ✅ **Checks Before Submission**  
- [ ] I have reviewed my files to ensure they meet the repository's guidelines.  
- [ ] I have tested my files by reading them in a Jupyter notebook via URL to confirm accessibility.
